buildzone
=========

BuildZone is a set of bash scripts designed to build a Linux Distribution from sources and will include a Package Manager (PM), probaly Pacman, from ArchLinux. Although being biased towards building DolphinOS, these scripts should be easily modded for just about any distribution.
